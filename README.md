# InjectiveGroversAlgorithm
Grover's Algorithm allows for sqrt(n) search times.  
By adding extra qubits which are not put through grover's diffusion operator can allow for interesting ways to manipulate the qubits inside grover's algorithm.  
These qubits can keep certain qubits in a superposition through grover's algorithm allowing for a variety of possible states to be output from Grover's algorithm.  
This could also model interaction from an external environment, such as interaction of a system with possible heat or radiation which change the state of our system inside grover's algorithm.  
Could potentially be applied to material science design by using grover's algorithm to find a material with certain properties,
and using ancillary qubits to keep the system of a superposition of possible temperatures or environments, which would find similar metamaterials,
such as a family of metamaterials which all operate at slightly different temperatures, rather than having to search for each individually.
